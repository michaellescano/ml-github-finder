This is my continuation in attempting to master React by implementing Hooks and Context APIs.  This website will allow you to search Github users, display the results and view the Github user's information.  A live version of the website can be found here: https://ml-github-finder.netlify.com/ 

## Technologies Used
- React Fundamentals (Components, props, state, etc)
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer)
- Context API and App Level State
